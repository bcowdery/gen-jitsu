GenJitsu
=========

GenJitsu is a library for generating realistic test data, inspired by the most excellent (GenFu)[http://genfu.io] CSharp library. 
GenJitsu can populate commonly named properties through reflection, using an internal database of values or random data. You can
override any of the value fillers to give **GenJitsu** hints on how to generate data.

GenJitsu makes heavy use of lambda functions, and therefore requires Java 8 (sad trombone).
